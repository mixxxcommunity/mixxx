// ReadAheadManager is a tool for keeping track of the engine's current position
// in a file. In the case that the engine needs to read ahead of the current
// play position (for example, to feed more samples into a library like
// SoundTouch) then this will keep track of how many samples the engine has
// consumed. The getNextSamples() method encapsulates the logic of determining
// whether to take a loop or jump into a single method. Whenever the Engine
// seeks or the current play position is invalidated somehow, the Engine must
// call notifySeek to inform the ReadAheadManager to reset itself to the seek
// point.
